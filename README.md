# Mickey Mouse Face with Pygame

This project utilises **Python** and **Pygame** to create a stylised **Mickey Mouse face** composed entirely of circles and ovals.  
It started as a **JavaScript graphics**, but was later polished and expanded in Python using Pygame for smoother rendering and more control.

## ✨ Features
- Draws Mickey’s head, ears, snout, mouth, nose, eyes, and pupils  
- Uses circles and rotated ovals for shaping  
- Polished in Python for better structure and smoother graphics  
- Real-time rendering with Pygame’s main loop  
- Press **ESC** or close the window to exit

## 💡 Inspiration

Originally written in JavaScript, this project was later refined in Python to take advantage of Pygame’s flexibility and rendering capabilities.
It demonstrates how simple geometric primitives can be layered and transformed to create a recognisable character.
